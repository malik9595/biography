        <h1>Narendra Modi</h1>
        <article>
        Narendra Modi was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, India, to a humble family. He helped his father sell tea at a railway station and later ran his own tea stall. Despite financial hardships, Modi pursued education and service to society with determination. <br />

Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization. That influenced his ideology and leadership style. He entered politics with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). His organizational skills and dedication make higher his rank.
<br />
Modi became Gujarat's Chief Minister in 2001 and holding the position until 2014. His tenure saw rapid economic growth and industrialization. But was also marked by controversy because of the 2002 Gujarat riots. Despite criticism, Modi focused on development projects, improving infrastructure, and attracting investments, earning a reputation as a pro-business leader. <br />
In 2014, Modi led the BJP to a historic victory, becoming India's Prime Minister. His policies included "Make in India," "Digital India," and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission). 
 <br />
 Modi's leadership has been transformative but polarizing. His government implemented landmark decisions, but critics question his policies on social harmony and democratic freedoms. Modi remains one of India's most influential leaders.
