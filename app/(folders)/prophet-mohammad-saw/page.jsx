Initially sharing his message privately, Khadijah was the first to accept Islam, followed by his cousin Ali. Ali was the first child to embrace Islam and his close friend Abu Bakr. Despite facing opposition from the Quraysh leaders and persecution of early Muslims, he continued spreading the message of Islam, emphasizing monotheism, good character, justice, equality, and compassion.
